# QR-code
QR code component from Frontend Mentor

Simple QR code component for desktop and mobile using nested flexboxes: one large grey box, a centered white box, and within it, a QR code.
Though the design guidance suggested supporting screen widths of 375px and 1440px the code support many more screen resolutions.
